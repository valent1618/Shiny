Shiny is a fake agency for freelance in React.

/!\ The data for the freelance is fetched with local repo, so if you want to see it in action ask me for the data. /!\

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

The project is a practice to learn React, so you can see lot of test, class and function components, useEffect, useState, Redux, context, styled-components, ... It's not representative of my way of working but it shows my skills.
